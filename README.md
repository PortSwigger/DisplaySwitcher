DisplaySwitcher Burp Suite Extension
============================

###### Registers new context menu items to switch between saved Display Settings profiles, and automatically switch
between profiles based upon the monitor in use.

---
This extension adds a new context menu item in Burp Suite to switch between defined Display Settings Profiles.

The extension has the following features: 
- The currently used Display settings may be saved to a new Display Settings Profile.
- The Extensions context menu can be used to switch between Display Settings Profiles without accessing Burp's Settings
  menu.
- Monitor Configurations may be defined to automatically switch to a paired Display Settings Profile when the
  DisplaySwitcher tab is raised.
- The Burp Suite Persistence API is used to maintain saved Display Settings Profiles and Monitor Configurations between
  Burp projects.
